Hi, welcome to my portfolio—a dedicated space to showcase my previous projects. Here, you'll find overviews of the business goals, solution architectures, and skill sets behind each project. I specialize in end-to-end AI solutions, particularly in healthcare and fintech, drawing on years of research and development in AI/ML—including statistical machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I have many details I'd like to share, so please feel free to explore the pages. 

If you'd like to discuss collaboration opportunities or have any questions, please email me.
