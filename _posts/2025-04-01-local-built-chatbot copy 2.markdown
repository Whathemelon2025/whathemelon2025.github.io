A locally deployed **state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM)** on an **NVIDIA RTX-series GPU**, enabling offline chatbot UI service. It supports **local chat history storage, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration**, and has **no usage limits or additional costs**. Designed for **individuals and small teams** who need privacy and flexibility.

## Key Concepts

##### The Rise of Lightweight & Open-Source LLMs
- Open-source LLMs are now comparable in performance to paid APIs.  
- Lightweight models like **Gemma 3** and **Llama 4** can run high-parameter versions on a **single GPU**.  

##### Advantages of Local Deployment
- **Unlimited Usage & No Hidden Fees**  
  No need for subscriptions or pay-per-use API costs (e.g. token-based pricing).  
- **Privacy & Offline Availability**  
  Runs without an internet connection, and chat history is stored **locally**.  
- **Highly Customizable**  
  - Adjust model parameters like `temperature` and `top-k` to suit personal preferences.  
  - Easily swap in **new open-source models** for better performance or specific needs.  
  - Multi-model response comparison allows for reference.  

##### Limitations
- **Requires Some IT Knowledge**  
  Users need basic technical skills to set up and maintain the model.  
- **Hardware Dependency**  
  - **Lower-end GPUs (e.g., GTX 1050)** can still only support **small-scale models**, affecting performance.  
  - A **single GPU setup** is not ideal for multi-user environments, making it **best suited for personal PCs**.
