A **cloud-based LLM application** providing API services in a low-code environment, making maintenance easier. The flexible infrastructure supports **high-end GPUs**, making it ideal for commercial applications such as customer service chatbots. The chatbot connects to an online database to **enhance domain knowledge** and **improve responses**, while also integrating with websites for personalized ad recommendations.

## Key Concepts

##### Rapid Evolution of LLMs
- The fast-paced advancement of AI makes cloud frameworks an effective way to switch models and stay up to date.
- Paid APIs such as OpenAI can be leveraged for better performance.

##### Advantages of Cloud Deployment
- **Flexible Pricing Model**  
  - Pay-as-you-go billing ensures cost predictability and control.  
  - No upfront hardware costsâ€”access industrial-grade GPUs (e.g., V100).  
  - PoC-friendly development environment, allowing for faster iteration of startup ideas.  

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  - MLOps integration ensures a smooth transition from PoC to long-term projects.  
  - Microservices offer high flexibility, making it easy to adapt to new AI trends like MCP.  
  - Can function as a standalone API backend or integrate with third-party software (e.g., Slack) and web applications.  

##### Limitations
- **Requires Cloud Expertise**  
  While designed as a low-code environment, familiarity with cloud services is still necessary.  
- **Potential Cost Risks**  
  Improper usage may lead to unnecessary expenses, requiring regular monitoring and evaluation.

1. **User Interaction**  
   - Users interact via web/mobile applications, triggering client requests based on specific actions.  

2. **API Gateway**  
   - Receives requests and routes them to appropriate API functions.  
   - Returns AI-generated responses to the frontend.  

3. **Lex (Conversational AI)**  
   - Chatbot builder supporting text and voice-based interactions.  

4. **Lambda (Query Processing & Prompt Engineering)**  
   - Manages queries and directs them to the appropriate tools for optimized AI responses.  

5. **Augmentation Tools**  
   - **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database storing user profiles, preferences, and chat history.  
   - **Bedrock:** Foundation LLM with customization options for fine-tuning.  
   - **Kendra:** Advanced search tool for retrieving relevant information:  
     1. S3-stored FAQs provide standardized responses to common inquiries (e.g., business hours).  
     2. Structured data like product catalogs enables precise product recommendations.  
     3. Web crawlers fetch external information and provide relevant links.  

> In some cases (filtered by Lambda), chatbot responses can be handled using FAQs instead of LLM-generated answers, reducing GPU usage.
